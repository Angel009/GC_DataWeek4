# GC_DataWeek4

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:

- 1) a tidy data set
- 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
- 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.


# Generated files
- `CodeBook.md.` describes the variables, the data, and any work that are performed to clean up the data.

- `run_analysis.R` contains the required code for doing the course project, that includes downloading and unzipping the required dataset.

- `tidy_data.txt` is a written out text file(tidy dataset) generated from `run_analysis.R`.


# Tidy Data Creation Prerequisites
In order to run the script that create the tidy data set, it is required to have the library `data.table` installed in R
